Lab 2: external button input and an external LED

The original code has been modified to meet the requirements of Lab 2.

- Added an external LED as GPIO output using pull-up resistor method
- Added changes to main.c and gpio.h to implement the external LED functionality
- LED transition now includes the external LED and it is controlled by a button event
